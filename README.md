WiFiDirectFileTransfer
======================

Objective:
Develop a file transfer application that is able to transfer files between Android devices without an access point and with minimal user input.

Background:
With a file transfer application that requires minimal user input and no wireless access point, file transfers can be done virtually anywhere and autonomously. The ease-of-use and benefit of localized, interest-based media sharing make such an application practical for anyone.

Approach:

•Research and understand Android programming and layout code

•Research existing device connection methods and frameworks

•Code file transfer, file management, and automatic connection systems

•Merge separate systems under a user friendly and custom-designed GUI


Result:

An application was developed with the following functionality:

• scans for nearby devices running our application

• transfers specific files once a connection is established

• custom file indexing system

• personalized file suggestion (work in progress)
