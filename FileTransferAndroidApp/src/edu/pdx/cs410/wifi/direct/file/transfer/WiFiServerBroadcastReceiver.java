/*
 WiFi Direct File Transfer is an open source application that will enable sharing 
 of data between Android devices running Android 4.0 or higher using a WiFi direct
 connection without the use of a separate WiFi access point.This will enable data 
 transfer between devices without relying on any existing network infrastructure. 
 This application is intended to provide a much higher speed alternative to Bluetooth
 file transfers.
